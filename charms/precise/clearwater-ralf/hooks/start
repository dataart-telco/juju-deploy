# This hook needs to be idempotent, so this could be run when ralf is
# already running, when it's running but not monitored by monit, when
# it's stopped but being monitored (so it's about to start), or stopped
# and unmonitored. To cover all these cases, restart ralf, restart monit,
# then finally have monit monitor ralf.  Note that restarting monit can
# fail because init will also restart it when it stops and restarting
# ralf can fail because monit will restart it.
