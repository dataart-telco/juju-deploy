# This hook needs to be idempotent, so this could be run when bono is
# already running, when it's running but not monitored by monit, when
# it's stopped but being monitored (so it's about to start), or stopped
# and unmonitored. To cover all these cases, restart bono, restart monit,
# then finally have monit monitor bono.  Note that restarting monit can
# fail because init will also restart it when it stops and restarting
# bono can fail because monit will restart it.
