[TelScale RestComm](http://www.telestax.com/restcomm/) is a next generation Cloud Communications Platform. It allows web developers to rapidly build voice, video, WebRTC, USSD, SMS, fax and rich messaging applications. Restcomm opens new revenue streams for service providers by exposing existing SS7 and IMS core network assets to application developers.

[Clearwater](http://www.projectclearwater.org) is an open source implementation of IMS (the IP Multimedia Subsystem) designed from the ground up for massively scalable deployment in the Cloud to provide voice, video and messaging services to millions of users. Clearwater combines the economics of over-the-top style service platforms with the standards compliance expected of telco-grade communications network solutions, and its Cloud-oriented design makes it extremely well suited for deployment in a Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) environment.
